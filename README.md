# Spot-the-bot
This is my graduation work in HSE. 
## The main idea
Representing words using word-to-vec transformation allows you to match a natural language word to a multidimensional vector and thereby turn a literary text into a time series. By evaluating the characteristics of this series, it is possible to evaluate the literary text, both globally and locally. On the other hand, using this approach, you can try to distinguish between sequences generated by humans and bots.
